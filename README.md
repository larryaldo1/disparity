**Framework Highlights**

	‚Ä¢	Autonomous Agents: Build and deploy self-governing AI agents optimized for task automation and learning.
	‚Ä¢	Data Decentralization: Ensure secure, accessible, and tamper-proof datasets using IPFS and blockchain technologies.
	‚Ä¢	Real-Time Adaptation: Agents evolve dynamically based on real-time data, enabling seamless workflow automation.
	‚Ä¢	Seamless Integrations: Plug into cutting-edge AI platforms like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Anthropic for advanced functionalities.

**Dynamic Agent Capabilities**

	‚Ä¢	Memory Evolution: Agents adapt by storing and learning from historical interactions.
	‚Ä¢	Behavioral Shifts: Agents adjust behaviors and priorities in response to changing datasets or goals.
	‚Ä¢	Decentralized Governance: Empower community-driven improvements to agent functionality and governance protocols.

**Creating DISPARITY Agents**

	1.	Define Identity: Assign unique names and roles to your AI agents.
	2.	Set Behavior: Use custom prompts and logic to guide your agents‚Äô workflows.
	3.	Integrate Data Sources: Enhance functionality by connecting external sources such as APIs, knowledge graphs, or decentralized storage systems.
	4.	Choose AI Models: Select AI models like GPT, LLaMA, or Hugging Face to power your agents‚Äô tasks.
